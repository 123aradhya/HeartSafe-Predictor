# HeartSafe-Predictor

Heart Disease Prediction Model

A machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various risk factors.

Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a heart disease prediction model using a combination of machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of patient records and can be used to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering using pandas and NumPy
- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn and TensorFlow
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Model deployment using Flask API

Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains 303 patient records with 14 features.

Model Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset, with a precision of 80% and a recall of 90%.
